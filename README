CPSC 456 Project 1: Ransom Worm

Members: David Poss, Billy Dang, Gerard Cortes

Usage: $ python ransom.py <username file> <passord file>

Notes:
1. Works similarly to replicator worm, but looks for a different marker file and will delete its files after executing.
2. The marker file for this worm is "ransom_marker.txt"
3. To unencrypt, run 
   $ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -d -in ineedmoneyplz.tar -out Documents -pass pass:cpsc456
   Then to untar that file, run 
   $ tar -xzf Documents
